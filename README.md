# Flappy-bird-converted-to-exe-
## Overview
Converted the source code from my Flappy bird repo to an exe file using **"Pyinstaller"** for portability and ease of use and more importantly lack of a python environment.

## Usage
Just run the .exe file in the repo on your local machine. **Ensure that the gallery folder and the .exe file are in the same directory**.
